      <description>Hey there, it&amp;rsquo;s Rezy Dev! Today, we’re going to talk about one of the most important parts of Rust programming—memory management. If you&amp;rsquo;ve been keeping up, you know Rust focuses on safety and performance, and memory management is key to that.
Understanding memory management is essential for writing efficient and safe Rust code. We’ll explore how Rust handles memory using concepts like The Stack, The Heap, Ownership, Borrowing, and more. Ready?</description>

      <description>Welcome back to my Rust series! Today, we&amp;rsquo;re exploring some key concepts: data types and variables. Whether you&amp;rsquo;re working with data during a pentest or creating a custom tool, knowing how Rust manages these basics is crucial.
Types In Rust, every value has a specific type, and understanding these types is crucial, especially when handling different data structures. Rust is a statically typed language, which means that all variable types are known at compile time.</description>

      <description>Hey there! I&amp;rsquo;m really pumped to take you on a journey into the world of Rust today. We&amp;rsquo;re going to write our very first Rust program, and I&amp;rsquo;ll explain some key concepts along the way to help you feel like a pro. Let&amp;rsquo;s dive in!
Cargo: The Build System and Package Manager Before we start coding, let&amp;rsquo;s talk about Cargo. Think of Cargo as your best friend in Rust. It&amp;rsquo;s the official build system and package manager for Rust, and it&amp;rsquo;s a game-changer.</description>

      <title>Introduction and Installation of Rust Language</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/rust/introduction-and-installation-of-rust-language/</link>

      <description>Introduction Rust is a modern programming language that has become popular because it combines speed, control, and safety. It offers the performance and control of languages like C and C++, while also ensuring memory safety, which is a big advantage seen in newer languages like Python. Rust uses new ideas that might be different from what you know in other languages, so it needs careful thought and understanding.
One challenge with Rust is that it needs a more structured way of learning.</description>
