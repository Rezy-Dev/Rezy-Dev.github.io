      <title>Freelancer Writeup - HackTheBox</title>

      <description>Freelancer is a Hard Difficulty machine is designed to challenge players with a series of vulnerabilities that are frequently encountered in real-world penetration testing scenarios. It covers a broad range of skills, including identifying business logic flaws in web applications, exploiting common vulnerabilities like insecure direct object reference (IDOR) and authorization bypass, and engaging with SQL impersonation attacks, which may not be common but are still critical to understand. Players will work through various scenarios, such as exposing sensitive information through directory enumeration and manually building SQL queries, which mimic the tasks typically required in real-life assessments. Advanced exploitation techniques are introduced, including remote code execution via SQL features and Windows memory forensics, which add depth to the challenges. Active Directory attacks are featured heavily, focusing on exploiting the AD Recycle Bin and the &amp;#34;Backup Operators&amp;#34; group, both of which have practical implications in modern environments. Password spraying, hash cracking, and bypassing antivirus tools also form part of the lab, ensuring a comprehensive experience that tests basic and advanced penetration testing techniques. Expect a blend of logical reasoning, technical exploitation, and real-world problem-solving throughout this lab.</description>

      <title>SolarLab Writeup - HackTheBox</title>

      <description>SolarLab is a medium Windows machine that starts with a webpage featuring a business site. Moreover, an SMB share is accessible using a guest session that holds files with sensitive information for users on the remote machine. An attacker can extract valid credentials from this file and log in to a page allowing employees to fill out forms for company purposes. These forms are turned into PDFs using the ReportLab library, which is vulnerable to [CVE-2023-33733](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-33733). After some exploit development/modification, the attacker can get code execution as the user blake on the remote machine. Further enumeration of the remote machine reveals that Openfire is installed and running locally. By using a SOCKS tunnel, the attacker can access the Administrator Console for Openfire. It turns out that the version installed is vulnerable to [CVE-2023-32315](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-32315), which allows the attacker to bypass the authentication screen, upload a malicious plugin, and get code execution as the openfire user. The openfire user can read the logs from when the server was installed and extract all the necessary information to crack the Administrator&amp;#39;s password, and it turns out that this password is reused for the local Administrator account.</description>

      <title>Mailing Writeup - HackTheBox</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/writeups/hackthebox/mailing/</link>

      <description>Mailing is an easy Windows machine that runs hMailServer and hosts a website vulnerable to Path Traversal. This vulnerability can be exploited to access the hMailServer configuration file, revealing the Administrator password hash. Cracking this hash provides the Administrator password for the email account. We leverage [CVE-2024-21413](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-21413) in the Windows Mail application on the remote host to capture the NTLM hash for user maya. We can then crack this hash to obtain the password and log in as user maya via WinRM. For privilege escalation, we exploit [CVE-2023-2255](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-2255) in LibreOffice.</description>
