      <description>Freelancer is a Hard Difficulty machine is designed to challenge players with a series of vulnerabilities that are frequently encountered in real-world penetration testing scenarios. It covers a broad range of skills, including identifying business logic flaws in web applications, exploiting common vulnerabilities like insecure direct object reference (IDOR) and authorization bypass, and engaging with SQL impersonation attacks, which may not be common but are still critical to understand. Players will work through various scenarios, such as exposing sensitive information through directory enumeration and manually building SQL queries, which mimic the tasks typically required in real-life assessments. Advanced exploitation techniques are introduced, including remote code execution via SQL features and Windows memory forensics, which add depth to the challenges. Active Directory attacks are featured heavily, focusing on exploiting the AD Recycle Bin and the &amp;#34;Backup Operators&amp;#34; group, both of which have practical implications in modern environments. Password spraying, hash cracking, and bypassing antivirus tools also form part of the lab, ensuring a comprehensive experience that tests basic and advanced penetration testing techniques. Expect a blend of logical reasoning, technical exploitation, and real-world problem-solving throughout this lab.</description>

      <title>Intuition Writeup - HackTheBox</title>

      <description>Intuition is a Hard Linux machine highlighting a CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) attack during the initial foothold, along with several other intriguing attack vectors. To gain a foothold, you must first exploit a CSRF vulnerability, followed by exploiting [CVE-2023-24329](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/102153) in the Python `urllib` module to access files on the server. This allows you to disclose the application&amp;#39;s source code, leading to the discovery of credentials needed to access the FTP server via an LFI (Local File Inclusion) vulnerability. Once inside the box, you must perform log analysis to progress to the next user and conduct a code review combined with a small amount of scripting. To achieve root access, you need to reverse engineer and exploit a custom binary, which is then leveraged to exploit [CVE-2023-5115](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-5115), a path traversal attack in the Ansible automation platform.</description>
